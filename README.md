# Stock_Info_Easy

This Python package is an implementation of the existing  _yfinance wrapper_, one of the  widely used yahoo finance API wrappers.<br>


The currently available Yahoo finance API wrappers take __company symbols__ as input queries instead of company names, and this often causes confusion as it is difficult to guess company symbols by heart. <br>
(eg. what is the abbreviation of the company name, _Apple, is it `APPL`? `AAPL`? or `APLE`?  (ans: the company symobol of apple is AAPL)_  

Therefore, this package aims to provide an improved functionality of querying by making it possible for users to fetch stock data by __company name(s) alone!__ <br><br>
Additionally, this package generates the stock data in dynamic formats, such as visualizations, data table, stock price forecast, and an audio file with daily prime stock price.
<br>

The fetched data table includes: <br>
* _`company name, open, high, low, close (closing price), adj close, volume, daily return, and PE ratios.`_<br>
<br>


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install stock_info_easy
```


## Usage

### 1. Fetch Stock Data
Insert the name of a company inside the `get_hist_data` function. <Br> 
_ex) ['amazon', 'apple', 'google', 'microsoft']_
```python

# By default, today's date will be used as end_date when the end_date is not specified. 

>>> data_list, comp_names_abbr, company_list, comp_names = \
stock_info_easy.get_hist_data((['amazon', 'apple', 'google', 'microsoft']), \
start_date="01/04/2022", end_date = "2022-01-10") 

```

```python

# To view the stock data as a table, 
# Type "data_list" (to view all) or "company_list[i]", i = index of the company. 

# stock info of all queried companies.
>>> data_list 
```

```python

# first company info (amazon).
>>> company_list[0]  
```

# second company info (apple).
>>> company_list[1]  
```

</p>
<br>


### 2. Visualization of Closing Price

```python

# To generate the visualization of Closing Price, copy-paste below function as it is.
>>> get_closing_price_viz(company_list, comp_names) 
```

</p>
<br>

### 3. Visualization of Daily Return

```python

# To generate the visualization of Daily Return, copy-paste below function as it is.
>>> get_daily_return_viz(company_list, company_names)
```

</p>

### 4. Prime Stock Info on Audio
This package provides key stock information such as PE ratio and basic company information of all queries companies in an audio format. 

```python

# Can customize the audio filename in the "audio_filename" parameter.
>>> generate_audio(comp_names_abbr, audio_filename='default1.mp3') 
```
<br>

### 5. Prediction on Closing Price
This package uses the time series LSTM vanila model to predict the closing price. 
LSTM model is built with two hidden LSTM layers followed by a standard feedforward output layer. 

```python
# Copy-paste the below function.
# The window size and prediction window size can be customized. 

>>> stock_info_easy.predict_future_price(data_list, comp_names_abbr, \
windown_size=30, predict_window_size=10, predict=True)
